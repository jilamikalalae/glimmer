## Project Description
Glimmer is a dress rental platform that serves as an intermediary, offering a convenient and cost-effective solution for individuals looking for stylish, high-quality dresses for special occasions. By bridging the gap between dress owners (lessors) and renters (lessees), Glimmer provides an efficient way for lessors to list their outfits and for lessees to find and rent the perfect dress. Acting as a middleman, the platform ensures smooth transactions, featuring secure payment options and a streamlined rental process, making it easy for both parties to connect and complete their rentals with confidence.
